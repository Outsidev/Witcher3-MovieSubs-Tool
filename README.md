# Witcher3-MovieSubs-Tool

##What it does?
It takes usm and subs files inside of witch3r's bundle files, extracts them to your mods folder(you have to create it in your witcher directory). While extracting, it applies new subtitle strings from given text file to replace **english** subtitles. With that, game reads new movies from mods folder.

But you have to create metadata of your newly created mod movies with [Witcher tools](http://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/news/12550/?), like creation of any w3 mod. This only creates existing movies with new subtitles.

Code is little mess, but i hope it gives at least little idea about usm and bundle format. Some of the functions intented to use in our translation. Comments and some of the code parts in Turkish language, sorry if it not makes sense.

This program orginally used in Unoffical Turkish Translation of Witcher 3.
